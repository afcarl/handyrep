# -------------------------------
# PostgreSQL recovery config file
# -------------------------------
#
# Edit this file to provide the parameters that PostgreSQL needs to
# perform an archive recovery of a database, or to act as a replication
# standby.
#
# If "recovery.conf" is present in the PostgreSQL data directory, it is
# read on postmaster startup.  After successful recovery, it is renamed
# to "recovery.done" to ensure that we do not accidentally re-enter
# archive recovery or standby mode.
#
#---------------------------------------------------
# ARCHIVING Replication Parameters
#---------------------------------------------------

# set the below if you are also doing replication via WAL file
# archiving, with or without streaming

# standby_mode
#
# When standby_mode is enabled, the PostgreSQL server will work as a
# standby. It will continuously wait for the additional XLOG records, using
# restore_command and/or primary_conninfo.

standby_mode = on

# restore command
# specifies the shell command that is executed to copy log files
# back from archival storage.  The command string may contain %f,
# which is replaced by the name of the desired log file, and %p,
# which is replaced by the absolute path to copy the log file to.
#
# It is important that the command return nonzero exit status on failure.
# The command *will* be asked for log files that are not present in the
# archive; it must return nonzero when so asked.
#
# NOTE that the basename of %p will be different from %f; do not
# expect them to be interchangeable.

restore_command = 'cp /var/lib/postgresql/wal_archive/%f %p'

# archive_cleanup_command
#
# specifies an optional shell command to execute at every restartpoint.
# This can be useful for cleaning up the archive of a standby server.

archive_cleanup_command = 'pg_archivecleanup /var/lib/postgresql/wal_archive %r'

# recovery_target_timeline
# Set to 'latest' to follow the master if it switches timeline
# requires version 9.3 or WAL file archiving to be effective

recovery_target_timeline = 'latest'
